# Chunk 8 — Frontend block registry + summary/sources/media renderers

## Goal

Build the frontend-side block abstraction that later chunks expand. Introduce a **block registry** keyed by `BlockType` that returns the renderer component for each block. Port today's inline-text / sources-panel / media-bar behavior into three block renderers (`SummaryBlock`, `SourcesBlock`, `MediaBlock`) without changing observable behavior — the existing SSE path still drives rendering. No new event wiring yet (Chunk 10 does that).

After this chunk: `MessageItem` composes blocks by iterating a list and dispatching via the registry instead of hard-coding three branches.

## Files

- `frontend/src/lib/response-types.ts` — new. TypeScript mirror of the backend `ResponseEnvelope` / `Block` / `BlockType` / `BlockState`.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/blocks/index.ts` — new. Block registry.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/blocks/SummaryBlock.tsx` — new.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/blocks/SourcesBlock.tsx` — new.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/blocks/MediaBlock.tsx` — new.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/blocks/BlockShell.tsx` — new. Common skeleton + state handling (loading / partial / ready / failed).
- `frontend/src/components/chat/MessageItem.tsx` — edit to compose from blocks using the registry.
- `frontend/src/components/chat/__tests__/blocks.test.tsx` — new vitest tests.

Read-only: `frontend/src/lib/api-types.ts`, existing `SourcesPanel.tsx`, `MediaBar.tsx`.

## Actions

1. **TS mirror types** (`response-types.ts`). Keep field names identical to the Python dataclasses for straight deserialization:

   ```ts
   export type BlockState = "loading" | "partial" | "ready" | "omitted" | "failed";
   export type BlockType = "summary" | "key_facts" | "steps" | "comparison" |
                           "sources" | "media" | "cta_links" | "clarification" |
                           "follow_ups" | "status";

   export interface Block {
     id: string;
     type: BlockType;
     state: BlockState;
     seq: number;
     reason?: string;
     content?: string;
     items?: any[];
     comparison?: { left: any; right: any; dimensions: string[] };
   }

   export interface ResponseEnvelope {
     request_id: string;
     mode: "direct" | "standard" | "rich" | "deep" | "search" | "artifact";
     status: "streaming" | "complete" | "failed";
     hero?: { title: string; subtitle?: string; image_url?: string };
     blocks: Block[];
     source_surface: any[];
     artifact_surface?: any;
     spoken_text?: string;
   }
   ```

2. **BlockShell** — uses shadcn/ui primitives (`Card`, `Skeleton`). Renders loading skeleton for `loading`/`partial`, the child for `ready`, a muted failure chip for `failed` with `reason`. No raw `<div>` styling beyond what shadcn already provides. Must obey Onyx Material elevation rules (Level 1–2 for blocks).

3. **Block registry** (`blocks/index.ts`):

   ```ts
   import { SummaryBlock } from "./SummaryBlock";
   import { SourcesBlock } from "./SourcesBlock";
   import { MediaBlock } from "./MediaBlock";

   export const BLOCK_REGISTRY: Partial<Record<BlockType, React.FC<{ block: Block }>>> = {
     summary: SummaryBlock,
     sources: SourcesBlock,
     media: MediaBlock,
   };

   export function renderBlock(block: Block): React.ReactNode {
     const C = BLOCK_REGISTRY[block.type];
     if (!C) return null;          // unknown type: silently skip (chunk 14/15 fill the rest)
     return <C key={block.id} block={block} />;
   }
   ```

4. **`SummaryBlock`** — renders `block.content` as markdown (use the markdown renderer already in `MessageItem.tsx`, do not introduce a new dep). Delegates state chrome to `BlockShell`.

5. **`SourcesBlock`** — wraps today's `SourceChip` row behavior; `block.items` is a `Source[]` shape. The inline chip row renders here; the richer `SourcesPanel` side drawer stays driven by the envelope's `source_surface` (wired in Chunk 11). Do NOT delete `SourcesPanel.tsx` in this chunk.

6. **`MediaBlock`** — wraps today's `MediaBar` logic; `block.items` is the existing `MediaCard[]` discriminated union. Preserve current behavior exactly (YouTube cards, channel cards, scroll layout).

7. **MessageItem refactor**:
   - Derive a `blocks: Block[]` from the existing `SynthesisData` payload client-side for now (until Chunk 10 consumes the envelope from the wire). Build it with:
     - one `summary` block with `content = synthesis.response`, `state = "ready"`.
     - one `sources` block with `items = synthesis.sources ?? []`, `state = "ready" | "omitted"`.
     - one `media` block with `items = synthesis.media ?? []`, `state = "ready" | "omitted"`.
   - Replace the three hard-coded render branches with `blocks.map(renderBlock)`.
   - Keep the existing streaming/interim text path intact — the summary block can accept a streaming content update from the same source today.
   - Preserve `ThinkingIndicator` and `PipelineInfoPopover` — unchanged.

8. **Tests** (vitest + React Testing Library pattern already in repo):
   - Render `SummaryBlock` with a `ready` block → content visible.
   - Render `SummaryBlock` with `loading` → skeleton visible.
   - Render `SourcesBlock` with 0 items + `state="omitted"` → renders nothing (doesn't crash).
   - Render `MessageItem` with a `SynthesisData` payload → exactly one summary + optional sources + optional media, matching the current pixel behavior.

## Verify

```
npm --prefix frontend run test -- blocks && npm --prefix frontend run build
```

Tests pass. Build succeeds. Manual smoke test: run `./run.sh`, send a calculator query; the rendered bubble matches today's look (the refactor is intentionally invisible).

## Commit message

```
refactor(chat): block registry + summary/sources/media renderers

MessageItem now composes its output by iterating a list of Blocks
and dispatching via BLOCK_REGISTRY instead of hard-coding three
branches. Behavior is unchanged — blocks are derived client-side
from the existing SynthesisData payload. Chunk 10 switches the
source of truth to the response envelope streamed from the
backend.

This is the foundation for every future block type.
